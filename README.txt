update from POS-02-2013

1. virtual keyboard is now positioned such that it become visible on screen.
2. List view on each page get updated on insert,update,delete of a record. (in previous version one has to refresh the page to see the update from database).
   Here there is no postbacks to get the new/updated data from DB, hence page load is reduced!!!


NOTE: there is no change in database.
